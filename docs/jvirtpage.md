# jvirtpage.css - Render a virtual page view in Joplin's previewer

jvirtpage.css is a stylesheet that will enable any note within the Joplin
application to render as an aesthetically pleasing virtual page in the Joplin
markdown viewer (the previewer).

By default, the page will be …
- US Letter with 1in margins
- Black text
- White paper
- Darkened "desktop"

> All of these are are adjustable. See "switches" below.

Exported to PDF or Print will … do what you expect preserve the page dimensions
and margins. Except in the case of …

## Methods of Enabling the Stylesheet

There are five ways to enable this stylesheet for a note. Either … (1) import
it into your note from the filesystem, or (2) import it into your note from the
web, (3) import it from a dedicated stylesheet note, (4) configure the "Import
Local CSS" plugin to set the stylesheet as the default for all notes, or add
the stylesheet to `userstyle.css`.

> Do this first before doing anything else:  
> Install the "Import local CSS" Joplin plugin (and restart).

1. Importing the stylesheet from the filesystem …

- Then do this at the top of your note …
```html
<style>
    @import url("/path/to/joplin-tweaks/jvirtpage.css");
</style>
```

2. If you are importing this into your note from the web …

- Stick the `jvirtpage.css` somewhere on the web where it is accessible to
  your system
- Change the `@import` example above to look something like:
  `@import url("https://mywebserver.com/pub/jvirtpage.css";`

3. If you want to import from a "CSS note" …

- Create note. Name it something like `jvirtpage.css`
- Copy this stylesheet into the note
- Wrap the whole thing in a ``\`css and ``\` fenced code block  
  *You may have to delete all of the preliminary comments (they sometimes break the plugin)*
- Right click on the css note and "Copy Markdown Link"
- Use only the :/HASHVALUE part of it and, for example …
  `@import url(":/7d66d959fa974468b4670db7228943a1");`

4. If you want this formattting available by default for ALL of your notes …

- Perform step 3 above.
- Add the copied link to Tools > Options > Import CSS > Global CSS:
  `[jvirtpage.css](:/7d66d959fa974468b4670db7228943a1)`
- This configuration must be repeated on each device.

4.b. If you want this formatting available by default for all notes, but only
enabled with a switch …

- Perform step 4 above
- Edit the CSS note and uncomment the `:has( div#jvp ) {`  and `}` lines that
  wrap `@media screen` and `@media print`
- Add `<div id="jvp"></div>` to any note you wish to be rendered as a virtual
  page. In this case, without the `<div>` element, the page will be rendered
  according to Joplin's defaults.

5. Add stylesheet to `userstyle.css` (not recommended)

If you cut-n-paste this styles sheet into the `userstyle.css` inside the
`joplin-desktop` folder (Linux/macOS: `~/.config/joplin-desktop/` -or- Windows:
`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.config\joplin-desktop\`) the styles will also be
persistent AND available to Joplin Cloud published notes. But, it's messy and I
don't recommend it. Instead, if you want the styles to be enabled for a
published note, I would instead directly import the stylesheet (option 2 or 3).


## Usage

Once imported into a note or enabled for all notes, the default behavior should
be evident. The preview for the styled note should be rendered as a "virtual
page".

Again, by default, the page will be …

- US Letter with 1in margins
  - 8.5in x 11in at maximum view
    - note that the length is infinite in the preview because the preview is
      note a "page" really, but …
    - a 1st-page marker is added so that you have an idea as to the length of a
      page.
  - The virtual page will shrink if need be when the viewport shrinks.
- Black text
- White paper
- Darkened "desktop"

If you want to change the default behavior, add this line anywhere in your
  note …
`<div id="jvp" class="SWITCH"></div>`

SWITCH can be one of …

- `off`  
  This will disable all of `jvirtpage.css`'s functionality.
  I.e., if you want to turn off these stylings for a particular note, just add
  `<div id="jvp" class="off"></div>` (or `<div id="jvp off"></div>`)
  anywhere within that note.
- `US`, `A4`, `A5`, `A6`, or `USh`  
  Page dimension switches (`USh` means US Half-letter). `US` is the default.
- `landscape`  
  Switch that flips the width x height. Default is portrait.
- `dim` or `dark`  
  Theme switches. Black text on a white page on a gray backound is the
  default.
- `no-1st-page-marker`  
  Turns off the marker that notes the page length of the current configuration.
- `no-pdf`  
  Turns off rendering a PDF in the note.
- `show-pdf`  
  Turns on rendering a PDF in the note (only useful if you turn it off by
  default by editing the initial constant value within the CSS).
- `no-links`  
  This will turn off all link functionality within a note and attempt to set
  their stylings to something neutral.
- `no-links-export`
  This will turn off all link functionality within an *exported* note and
  attempt to set their stylings to something neutral.

For example, many (maybe most) of my notes are configured as such:  
`<div id="jvp" class="dark no-pdf"></div>`
