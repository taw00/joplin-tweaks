/* Ensure <pre> preformatted blocks don't have scrollbars when exported to PDF
 *
 * At one point in time, if you exported a document that had a code
 * block (or an preformatted block) in it, and it would not fit in the
 * document width, scrollbars would be added to see the rest of the text.
 * This is fine when viewing on the screen, but not when exported to a PDF or
 * printed.
 *
 * This will trim anything beyond the page and remove the scrollbars.
 * Note, there are two settings for "white-space" to choose from here:
 *   - pre: preserves the formatting (the original intent), trims outside
 *          of the print block.
 *   - pre-wrap (Joplin's default): preserves the formatting until it wraps
 *          the line in order to fit all the data in a print block.
 *   This is a double-edged sword. At some level, we want preservation of
 *   data. But from another perspective, we want preservation of intent
 *   and leave it to the writer of the note to adjust their text or their
 *   inline CSS to fix output. I choose "pre".
 *
 * Add this CSS configuration block to your userstyle.css file found in â€¦
 * Linux/macOS: ~/.config/joplin-desktop/
 * -or-
 * Windows: C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.config\joplin-desktop\

/* Uncomment this :has and its mirroring brace at the end of the file if you
