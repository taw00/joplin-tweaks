/* Remove the WYSIWYG (MARKDOWN/RICH TEXT) button
 *
 * I like the traditional Markdown editor found in Joplin versus the wiz-bang
 * Rich Text Editor. For one reason, at least at one point in time, the Rich
 * Text Editor would do things like … remove any comments in your markdown
 * file. It may or may not still do that. Still … I prefer the simplicity of
 * the traditional markdown editor. And so, I remove the button that allows
 * switching away from it.
 *
 * Add this CSS configuration block to your userchrome.css file found in …
 * Linux/macOS: ~/.config/joplin-desktop/
 * -or-
 * Windows: C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.config\joplin-desktop\
